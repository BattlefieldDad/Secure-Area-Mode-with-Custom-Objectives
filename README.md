# Secure-Area-Mode-with-Custom-Objectives
A mode using custom objective code again. This one covers all of the base maps but may be out of date at this point. Updating the mode to cover new maps or change the capture areas can be done and details are given in the video. This is a small 4 vs game mode based on a series of rounds, with each team attempting to capture a single objective. The mode may contain a few bugs now, especially as updates and changes have come to the editor. I periodically test it to check it still works but this mode is really a bit outdates now that custom conquest has arrived. This could be made significantly more easily now using the built in objectives. There may still be interest in this and of course you can put as many objectives on a map as you want, wherever you want....
